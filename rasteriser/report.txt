- Full clipping in 4d space, including far plane. Instead of working on vertices,
  we performed clipping on the vector of triangles. With only 3 cases (0,1,2 vertices
  outside clipping plane) for each triangle, we can cover all cases, and all
  triangles are of fairly similar sizes and can be connected perfectly.

- Colour modes. When running, press spacebar to cycle between normal, white noise
  and night vision mode.

- Anti aliasing, average of the pixel and its 4 neighbours taken.

- Volume shadows, done slightly different from the standard way. A shadow buffer
  is used. Triangles are created with lines from the light position to the vertex
  of the boxes, then extending to ‘infinity’. Reduce light intensity at areas
  where shadow triangles exist. Reduce less at the edges and more in the centre
  of the triangles to give softer shadows. Only casted on the subjects of the scene
  (boxes) for efficiency.

- Texture, opacity, occlusion and normal mapping. Marble texture uses randomly
  generated small values to add to the plane normal to give a rough feel, whereas
  the other textures were downloaded online along with their normal, occlusion and
  opacity maps.

- HDR rendering (sort of??), 3 screen buffers are used, and the scene is rendered
  with various amount of indirect light. The average of these are taken to be
  printed on the screen. This helped with soft shadows and made the scene look
  more natural.
