Instructions
----------
Make to build and run as normal.

Basic 50%
----------
- Complete.

Extensions
----------
- Anti aliasing (This is turned off by default and in screenshot due to render time)
- Cramer's rule to produce t to determine intersection early
- Loading spheres
- Using square area light instead of point light
- Reflection
- Refraction
- Photon mapping using Russian Roulette
- KD tree for storing photon map (Implemented but not producing correct result :( ):
  - Working:
    - KD tree data structure working (No seg faults and pointers point to correct data)
    - Dimensions for sorting to find median being chosen correctly
    - Balancing of KD tree working (Depth of tree on both sides has max difference of one)
    - Photons being returned for radiance estimate seem to be the nearest
  - Not working:
    - Something wrong with nearest neighbour search as it is slower than expected
    - Giving wrong output (image attached)
