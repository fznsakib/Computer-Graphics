- 50% lab
- Anti aliasing (This is turned off in screenshot due to render time)
- Cramer's rule to produce t to determine intersection early
- Loading spheres
- Using square area light instead of point light
- Reflection
- Refraction
- Photon mapping using Russian Roulette
- KD tree for storing photon map (Implemented but not producing correct result :( )
  - KD tree data structure working (No seg faults and pointers point to correct data)
  - Balancing of KD tree working (Depth of tree on both sides has max difference of one)
  - Photons being returned are the nearest
  - However, hardly any photons being returned, and nearest neighbour search is slower than expected
